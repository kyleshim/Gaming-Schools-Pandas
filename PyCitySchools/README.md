Observations

Observation 1:
School Type plays a very important factor in average scores and pass percentages
The charter schools have consistenly higher averages and pass rates

Observation 2:
Budget per Student inversely correlates with averages and pass rates. 
Although you would expect schools with higher budgets per student to yield better results, they do not.
